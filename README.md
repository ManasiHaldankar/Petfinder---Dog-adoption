# Petfinder---Dog-adoption
The Pet finder dataset has been obtained from GitHub. 
I have used Tableau to create dashboards and stories based on the insights that I found in the dataset. 
This project was undertaken to provide the customer with various insights about the dogs that have been adopted.
The files above contain cleaned dataset and the tableau dashboards that I created for this project.
