# Petfinder---Dog-adoption
**Problem Statement** - Discovered adoptable breeds and their availability in cities of United States to promote the idea of “adopt not shop”.

The Pet finder dataset has been obtained from GitHub. It contains three files.

  **dog_descriptions** - This file contains more than 26000 rows. It contains important features such as dog_breed, color, size, age and sex.
  
  **dog_moves** - This file contains statewise distribution of number of imported and exported breeds.
  
  **dog_travel** - This file contains data about the city and state in which the breeds were found along with their description.
  
Cleaned the dataset using MS Excel and generated a series of Tableau dashboards to explore and analyze the data using advanced data visualizations such as calculated field, word cloud, heatmap, pie chart and stacked bar chart

From the project, we have inferred:
  i)    Statewise distribution of dog breeds
  
  ii)   Environmental friendliness of dogs with children, other dogs and cats
  
  iii)  Most adoptable breeds
  
  iv)   Overall dog popularity
